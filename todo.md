# List of TODO

* When a new view is activated (after run or view:code) close all open tabs. (also (maybe) collapse everything not related to the problem)
* Implement parser for codeforces-gym/codechef/atcoder/matcomgrader/coj (which are most popular online judges currently)

* [005](/src/core.ts): Restrict brute in time, and capture errors
  * Allow stopping a running program (such as sol.cpp/brute.cpp/gen.py/etc...)
* [007](/src/extension.ts): How can I have access to new process created using `openFolder`?
* Add Telegram group join link in the Readme
* Add gif to README. Gif should be a tutorial (how to use).

## QUICK TODO

* Test and provide example using other languages.
* Copy to clipboard (smart copy in the future with tool suggested by jcg) (Find in examples, create shortcut)

## Settings

Particular settings (per problem) configuration on current workspace.
This can be done creating such configurations globally and updating them per workspace (only problem here is that in one workspace might coexist several programs so best answer is probably creating a config file inside each problem and access them through cool UI settings provided by VSCode. This can be done since GitLens already do that.) Store also problem name on this config file, maybe URL.

* Make a new command to open particular settings of a problem

* [ ] Allow multiple solutions. (Don't check on this case. Try to figure out if this is the case)
* [ ] Is interactive (Don't check on this case. Try to figure out if this is the case)
